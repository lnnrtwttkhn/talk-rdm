# Motivation: "Open" Science should just be "Science"

.pull-left[
*"An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship.
The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures."*

Buckheit & Donoho (1995), paraphrasing Jon Claerbout

- Jon Claerbout, a distinguished exploration geophysicist at Stanford University
- He has also pointed out that we have reached a point where solutions are available - it is now possible to publish computational research that is really reproducible by others.

# Good Scientific Practice?

#### Excerpt from the "Rules of Good Scientific Practice" by the Max Planck Society (November 24, 2000)

> *"Scientific examinations, experiments and numerical calculations can only be reproduced or reconstructed if all the important steps are comprehensible.
> For this reason, full and adequate reports are necessary, and these reports must be kept for a minimum period of ten years, not least as a source of reference, should the published results be called into question by others."* <sup>1</sup>

#### Excerpt from your emplyoment contract


> *"The rules for safeguarding good scientific practice of the Max Planck Society dated November 24, 2000 in its current version* [üëÜ] *are part of the employment contract."*

Do we really meet these standards?

# Reproducible research

> *"[...] when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer."*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="70%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='<a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions.html" target="_blank">Table of Definitions for Reproducibility</a> by <i>The Turing Way</i> (CC-BY 4.0)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/reproducible-matrix.jpg") 
```

???

- **Reproducible:** A result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer.
- **Replicable:** A result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.
- **Robust:** A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.
- **Generalisable:** Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results. Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results. There will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question. Generalisation is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.

- Data is produced through code (e.g., task code)
- Data is manipulated by code and new data is generated
 - Mapping between input and output data
- This happens using specific software in specific versions

---

# "Practice" of research code and data management

--

- "*Where is the data?*"

- "*Can I see your code?*"

- "*Which version of the code and data did you use to produce this result?*"

- "*What is the difference between `data_version1_edit.csv` and `data_version8_new_final.csv`?*"

- "*Where did you get this file / code from?*"

- "*I get different results on my machine ...*"

- "*But it worked when I ran it last month?!*"

- *"Which value did you set for the input of this function?"*

- *"Data available upon reasonable request"*

# The solution?

> **Organize science like open-source software (OSS) development** <sup>1</sup>

#### **The tools already exist!**

1. **Version-control** and **dependency management**
  - Code, data and computational environments change all the time!
  - Example: Running the same analysis on your laptop, the cluster, or your collaborator's computer
  - Version-control (e.g., [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/)) and Software containers ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Singularity](https://singularity.hpcng.org/))
  - Citations, methods, data, etc. as research project dependencies

2. **Collaboration, communication, acknowledgement and contribution**
  - Raising questions, reporting errors, suggesting ideas via [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues/about-issues)
  - Proposing, discussing, and reviewing changes via [pull](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (GitHub) or [merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) (GitLab) requests
  - Services and infrastructure ([GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/), [OSF](https://osf.io/) etc.) to share and release research products
  - Contributions (by individuals or projects) can be tracked and categorized

#### Two-sentence summary:

> Non-invasive measurement of fast neural activity with spatial precision in humans is difficult. Here, the authors show how fMRI can be used to detect sub-second neural sequences in a localized fashion and report fast replay of images in visual cortex that occurred independently of the hippocampus.

# Version-control with Git

> Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a [...] set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later [...] ([Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html))

#### Git

- most pupular **distributed version control system**
- free, [open-source](https://github.com/git) command-line tool
- started by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#History) (creator of Linux) in 2005
- standard tool for any software developer
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) exist, e.g., [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)


???

- Back in the day: Software developers used BitKeeper to collaborate on code with colleagues
- Free access to BitKeeper was revoked after a company broke down in 2005
- A new solution was needed so Linus Torvalds coded it up
- First version after a couple of days

.pull-left[
#### Git as a distributed **version control** system
- keep track of changes in a directory (a "repository")
- take snapshots ("commits") of your repo at any time
- know the history of what was changed when by whom
- compare commits and go back to any previous state
- work on "branches" and flexibly "merge" them together

**save one file and all of its history instead of multiple versions of the same file**

```
]

--

#### Git as a **distributed** version control system
- "push" your repo to a "remote" location and share it
- host / share your repo on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket
- work with others on the same files at the same time
- others can read / copy / edit and suggest changes
- make your repo public and openly share your work

# Git mini-tutorial: Create a repository and add content

1\. Open the Terminal / command line on your computer

--

2\. Create a new Git repository

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git init my_project
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/my_project/.git/
```

--

3\. Move into the `my_project` directory using `cd` ("**c**hange **d**irectory")

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ cd my_project
```

--

4\. Create a `README.md` text file that contains the line `hello world`, using `echo`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ echo "hello world" >> README.md
```

--

5\. List the contents of the `my_project` directory, using `ls`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ ls
README.md
```

---

# Git mini-tutorial: Track contents

6\. Tell Git to track the changes in the `README.md` file, using `git add`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git add README.md
```

--

7\. *Commit* the changes in the `README.md` file to your repository's history, using `git commit`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git commit --message "initial commit"
  [master (root-commit) 5118725] initial commit 
  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) 
  create mode 100644 README.md
```

---

# Git mini-tutorial: Record changes over time

8\. Add another line to the `README.md` file, again using `echo`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ echo "goodbye world" >> README.md
```

--

9\. Tell Git to also track this recent change, again using `git add`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git add README.md
```

--

10\. Commit this additional change to the history of the repository, again using `git commit`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git commit -m "update README.md"
  [master c56c4c0] update README.md 
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) 
```

--

11\. Show the history of the repository using `git log`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git log --oneline
  c56c4c0 (HEAD -> master) update README.md 
  5118725 initial commit 
```

???

Show the current status of your repository using `git status`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git status 
On branch master 
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

# What is DataLad?

#### What is DataLad? (see the [10,000 feet](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/executive_summary.html) and [brief](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/philosophy.html) overview in the DataLad Handbook by [Wagner et al., 2020, *Zenodo*](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.3905791))

> *"DataLad is a software tool developed to aid with everything related to the evolution of digital objects"*

.footnote[
*Disclaimer:* I'm "only" an enthusiastic user of DataLad! üòä
]

--

- **"Git for (large) data"**
- free, [open-source](https://github.com/datalad/datalad) **command-line tool**
- building on top of **Git** and **git-annex**, DataLad allows you to **version control arbitrarily large files** in datasets.
- *"Arbitrarily large?"* - yes, see DataLad dataset of 80TB / 15 million files from the Human Connectome Project (see [details](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/usecases/HCP_dataset.html#usecase-hcp-dataset))

--

#### DataLad phiolosophy

- DataLad knows only two things: Datasets and files
- DataLad datasets are Git repository
- DataLad can version control arbitrarily large data
- DataLad minimizes custom procedures and data structures
- DataLad is developed for complete decentralization
- DataLad aims to maximize the (re-)use of existing 3rd-party data resources and infrastructure

```

> "*GIN is [...] a web-accessible repository store of your data based on git and git-annex that you can access securely anywhere you desire while keeping your data in sync, backed up and easily accessible [...]"*

--

#### Advantages of GIN (non-exhaustive list)

- free and open-source (could be hosted within MPIs / MPG)
- supports private and public repositories
- publicly funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)
- servers are on German land (near Munich, Germany)
- provides Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) (details [here](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/DOI))
- allows to set own license (details [here](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/Licensing))
- DataLad plays perfectly with GIN, since both use git + git-annex (details [here](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-139-gin.html))

# Publishing a DataLad dataset to GIN in only 4 steps

1\. Create a dataset

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
datalad create my_dataset
```

--

2\. Save data into the dataset

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
datalad save -m "add data to dataset"
```

--

3\. Add the GIN remote ("sibling")

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
datalad siblings add -d . --name gin --url git@gin.g-node.org:/my_username/my_dataset.git
```

--

4\. Transfer the dataset to GIN

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
datalad push --to gin
```

--

Done!<sup>1</sup> üéâ

<sup><sup>1</sup> To be fair, it's a bit more complex than that ... `r emoji::emoji("innocent")` (details [here](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-139-gin.html))</sup>

> "*A free service for all Max Planck employees and project partners with **more than 1TB of storage per user** for your researchdata.
> Profit from safe data storage, seamlessly integrated into your research workflow.*"

---

#### Suggested alternatives to GIN that can be used with DataLad (selection):

- [Keeper](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/) (Seafile) offers all Max Planck employees 1TB(!) of storage (expandable)
- [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/), popular in Psychology / Cognitive Neuroscience (see [details](http://docs.datalad.org/projects/osf/en/latest/))

#### Reproducible reports with [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) / [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

> *"R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code [...]"*

- Project documentation and main statistical analyses are written in RMarkdown (see [here](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/highspeed-analysis/tree/master/code))
- Documentation pages showcase non-executed code (used in subdatasets) in Python and Bash
- Statistical analyses are executed and website rendered automatically via [Continuous Integreation / Deployment (CI/CD)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/):
  1. In the [main project repository](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed), all RMarkdown files are [combined](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/_bookdown.yml#L22-36) using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) (across subdatasets)
  1. Input data is [automatically retrieved](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L5-75) from GIN and / or Keeper using DataLad (run in a [Docker container](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.docker/datalad/Dockerfile))
  1. The RMarkdown files are [run in Docker](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.docker/bookdown/Dockerfile) (executing main statistical analyses) and [rendered](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L99) into a static website

# Software containers and virtual environments

#### Software containers

> *"Containers allow a researcher to package up a project with all of the parts it needs - such as libraries, dependencies, and system settings - and ship it all out as one package."* (see [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/renv/renv-containers.html#what-are-containers))

- `highspeed-bids`: containerized conversion of MRI data to BIDS using [HeuDiConv](https://hub.docker.com/r/nipy/heudiconv)
- `highspeed-fmriprep`: containerized execution of pre-processing pipeline [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/singularity.html)
- `highspeed-mriqc`: containerized creation of MRI quality reports using [MRIQC](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docker.html)
- `highspeed-analysis`: containerized execution of statistical analyses in [custom R container](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.docker/bookdown/Dockerfile)
- `tools`, a personal collection of commonly used containers in a DatLad dataset (see [details](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/tools))

--

#### Virtual environments (e.g., [in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html))

> *"[...] it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. The solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages."*

# Summary, outlook, challenges and discussions

> *"He [Jon Claerbout] has also pointed out that we have reached a point where solutions are available - it is now possible to publish computational research that is really reproducible by others.*"

Buckheit & Donoho (1995), describing how Jon Claerbout and his team shared CD-ROMs with interactive code that could regenerate the figures in their books - in the *early 90s* *(addition in parantheses)*

--

#### The technical solutions are already available!

- Code and data management using Git / DataLad
- Reproducible computational environments using software containers
- Reliance on community standards for data organization and code style guides
- Project management via issue boards and pull / merge requests on GitHub / GitLab
- Focus education on reproducible science and technical skills

--

#### The long-term challenges are largely non-technical:
- moving towards a "culture of reproducibility" (cf. Russ Poldrack, see e.g., [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjW3t-qXAiE))
- changing incentives / funding schemes
- education, education, education
- implementing "slow science" (see e.g., [Frith, 2020, *TICS*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2019.10.007))

# Challenge: Relationship between code and data

- *"Which code produced which data?"*
- *"In which order do I need to execute the code?"*

--

#### Example solutions

- [datalad run](http://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/generated/man/datalad-run.html)

> `datalad run` *"[...] will record a shell command, and save all changes this command triggered in the dataset ‚Äì be that new files or changes to existing files."* (see [details](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/basics-run.html) in the DataLad handbook)

- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

> *"Make enables [...] to build and install your package without knowing the details of how that is done -- because these details are recorded in the makefile that you supply."*

> *"Make figures out automatically which files it needs to update, based on which source files have changed. It also automatically determines the proper order for updating files [...]"*
