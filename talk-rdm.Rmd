#### Two-sentence summary:

> Non-invasive measurement of fast neural activity with spatial precision in humans is difficult. Here, the authors show how fMRI can be used to detect sub-second neural sequences in a localized fashion and report fast replay of images in visual cortex that occurred independently of the hippocampus.

# What is DataLad?

#### What is DataLad? (see the [10,000 feet](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/executive_summary.html) and [brief](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/philosophy.html) overview in the DataLad Handbook by [Wagner et al., 2020, *Zenodo*](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.3905791))

> *"DataLad is a software tool developed to aid with everything related to the evolution of digital objects"*

.footnote[
*Disclaimer:* I'm "only" an enthusiastic user of DataLad! 😊
]

--

- **"Git for (large) data"**
- free, [open-source](https://github.com/datalad/datalad) **command-line tool**
- building on top of **Git** and **git-annex**, DataLad allows you to **version control arbitrarily large files** in datasets.
- *"Arbitrarily large?"* - yes, see DataLad dataset of 80TB / 15 million files from the Human Connectome Project (see [details](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/usecases/HCP_dataset.html#usecase-hcp-dataset))

--

#### DataLad phiolosophy

- DataLad knows only two things: Datasets and files
- DataLad datasets are Git repository
- DataLad can version control arbitrarily large data
- DataLad minimizes custom procedures and data structures
- DataLad is developed for complete decentralization
- DataLad aims to maximize the (re-)use of existing 3rd-party data resources and infrastructure

# DataLad: What is a dataset?

> *"A dataset is a directory on a computer that DataLad manages."*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="40%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='see <a href="http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-101-create.html" target="_blank">DataLad Handbook: Create a new dataset</a>'}
knitr::include_graphics("http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/_images/dataset.svg") 
```

> "*You can create new, empty datasets [..] and populate them, or transform existing directories into datasets.*"

---

# DataLad: Version-control arbitrarily large files

> *"Building on top of Git and git-annex, DataLad allows you to version control arbitrarily large files in datasets."*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="40%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='see <a href="http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-102-populate.html" target="_blank">DataLad Handbook: How to pupulate a dataset</a>'}
knitr::include_graphics("http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/_images/local_wf.svg") 
```

> *"[...] keep track of revisions of data of any size, and view, interact with or restore any version of your dataset [...]."*

---

# DataLad: Dataset consumption and collaboration

> *"DataLad lets you consume datasets provided by others, and collaborate with them."*

> *"You can **install existing datasets** and update them from their sources, or create sibling datasets that you can **publish updates** to and **pull updates** from for collaboration and data sharing."*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="70%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='see <a href="https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-105-install.html" target="_blank">DataLad Handbook: Install an existing dataset</a>'}
knitr::include_graphics("http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/_images/collaboration.svg") 
```

# DataLad: Dataset linkage

> *"Datasets can contain other datasets (subdatasets), **nested arbitrarily deep.**"*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="70%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='see <a href="http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-106-nesting.html" target="_blank">DataLad Handbook: Nesting datasets</a>'}
knitr::include_graphics("http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/_images/linkage_subds1.svg") 
```

> *"Each dataset has an independent [...] history, but can be registered at a precise version in higher-level datasets. This allows to **combine datasets** and to perform commands recursively across a hierarchy of datasets, and it is the basis for advanced provenance capture abilities."*

---

# DataLad: Full provenance capture and reproducibility

> *"DataLad allows to **capture full provenance**: The origin of datasets, the origin of files obtained from web sources, complete machine-readable and automatically reproducible records of how files were created (including software environments)."*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="50%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='see <a href="http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/usecases/provenance_tracking.html" target="_blank">DataLad Handbook: Provenance tracking</a> and <a href="http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/basics-run.html" target="_blank">run commands</a>'}
knitr::include_graphics("http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/_images/reproducible_execution.svg") 
```

> *"You or your collaborators can thus re-obtain or reproducibly **recompute content with a single command**, and make use of extensive provenance of dataset content **(who created it, when, and how?)**."*

---

# DataLad: Third party service integration

> *"**Export datasets to third party services** such as GitHub, GitLab, or Figshare with built-in commands."*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="60%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='see <a href="http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/basics-thirdparty.html" target="_blank">DataLad Handbook: Third-party infrastructure</a>'}

# DataLad: Metadata handling

> *"**Extract, aggregate, and query dataset metadata.** This allows to automatically obtain metadata according to different metadata standards (EXIF, XMP, ID3, BIDS, DICOM, NIfTI1, ...), store this metadata in a portable format, share it, and search dataset contents."*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='see <a href="http://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/metadata.html" target="_blank">DataLad Handbook: Metadata</a>'}

# *"How close are you to full reproducibility?"*

#### [...] *full* reproducibility?

#### Reproducibility of statistical results in our [recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21970-2#code-availability):

- Our [project website](https://wittkuhn.mpib.berlin/highspeed/) shows all figures and statistical results next to the corresponding R code
- The analyses are written in [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) notebooks which are run and rendered into the project website using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and deployed to [GitLab pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) using [continuous integration (CI)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) (for details, see [here](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml))
- The input data are retrieved from DataLad datasets in the CI (see [here](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L5-93))
- R and DataLad are run in dedicated Docker containers (see [here](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.docker/bookdown/Dockerfile) and [here](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.docker/datalad/Dockerfile) for the Docker recipes)

# Random tips to help you keep track

- Use [tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) to mark the state ("commit") in your code and data repo that was used to generate the results in the paper

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git tag -a v1.0 -m "version used to generate results in our paper"
```

- Use software containers, e.g., [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html)

> Containers allow a researcher to package up a project with all of the parts it needs - such as libraries, dependencies, and system settings - and ship it all out as one package. Anyone can then open up a container and work within it, viewing and interacting with the project as if the machine they are accessing it from is identical to the machine specified in the container - regardless of what their computational environment actually is. They are designed to make it easier to transfer projects between very different environments.

# Good Scientific Practice?

#### Excerpt from the "Rules of Good Scientific Practice" by the Max Planck Society (November 24, 2000)

> *"Scientific examinations, experiments and numerical calculations can only be reproduced or reconstructed if all the important steps are comprehensible.
> For this reason, full and adequate reports are necessary, and these reports must be kept for a minimum period of ten years, not least as a source of reference, should the published results be called into question by others."* <sup>1</sup>

# Reproducible research

> *"[...] when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer."*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="70%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='<a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions.html" target="_blank">Table of Definitions for Reproducibility</a> by <i>The Turing Way</i> (CC-BY 4.0)'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/reproducible-matrix.jpg") 
```

???

- **Reproducible:** A result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer.
- **Replicable:** A result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.
- **Robust:** A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.
- **Generalisable:** Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results. Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results. There will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question. Generalisation is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.

- "*Where is the data?*"

- "*Can I see your code?*"

- "*Which version of the code and data did I use to produce this result?*"

- "*What is the difference between `data_version1_edit.csv` and `data_version8_new_final.csv`?*"

- "*Where did you get this file / code from?*"

- "*I get different results on my machine ...*"

- "*But it worked when I ran it last month?!*"

- *"Which value did you set for the input of this function?"*

# The solution?

> **Organize science like open-source software (OSS) development**

--

#### **The tools already exist!**

--

1. **Version-control** and **dependency management**

  - Code, data and computational environments change all the time!
  - Example: Running the same analysis on your laptop, the cluster, or your collaborator's computer
  - Known solutions: Version-control (e.g., [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/)) and software containers ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Singularity](https://singularity.hpcng.org/))

--

2. **Collaboration, communication, acknowledgement and contribution**

  - Raising questions, reporting errors, suggesting ideas via [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues/about-issues)
  - Proposing, discussing, and reviewing changes via [pull](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (GitHub) or [merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) (GitLab) requests
  - Services and infrastructure ([GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/), [OSF](https://osf.io/) etc.) to share and release research products
  - Contributions (by individuals or projects) can be tracked and categorized

# Version-control with Git

> Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a [...] set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later [...] ([Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html))

#### Git

- most pupular **distributed version control system**
- free, [open-source](https://github.com/git) command-line tool
- started by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#History) (creator of Linux) in 2005
- standard tool for any software developer
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) exist, e.g., [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)


???

- Back in the day: Software developers used BitKeeper to collaborate on code with colleagues
- Free access to BitKeeper was revoked after a company broke down in 2005
- A new solution was needed so Linus Torvalds coded it up
- First version after a couple of days

# Git mini-tutorial: Create a repository and add content

1\. Open the Terminal / command line on your computer

--

2\. Create a new Git repository

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git init my_project
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/my_project/.git/
```

--

3\. Move into the `my_project` directory using `cd` ("**c**hange **d**irectory")

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ cd my_project
```

--

4\. Create a `README.md` text file that contains the line `hello world`, using `echo`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ echo "hello world" >> README.md
```

--

5\. List the contents of the `my_project` directory, using `ls`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ ls
README.md
```

---

# Git mini-tutorial: Track contents

6\. Tell Git to track the changes in the `README.md` file, using `git add`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git add README.md
```

--

7\. *Commit* the changes in the `README.md` file to your repository's history, using `git commit`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git commit --message "initial commit"
  [master (root-commit) 5118725] initial commit 
  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) 
  create mode 100644 README.md
```

---

# Git mini-tutorial: Record changes over time

8\. Add another line to the `README.md` file, again using `echo`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ echo "goodbye world" >> README.md
```

--

9\. Tell Git to also track this recent change, again using `git add`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git add README.md
```

--

10\. Commit this additional change to the history of the repository, again using `git commit`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git commit -m "update README.md"
  [master c56c4c0] update README.md 
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) 
```

--

11\. Show the history of the repository using `git log`

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git log --oneline
  c56c4c0 (HEAD -> master) update README.md 
  5118725 initial commit 
```

???

Show the current status of your repository using `git status`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git status 
On branch master 
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

&rarr; Details on YODA principles can also be found in the Appendix

---

# P1: *"One thing, one dataset"*

- Structure study elements (data, code, results) in dedicated directories
- Input data in `/inputs`, code in `/code`, results in `/outputs`, execution environments in `/envs`
- Use dedicated projects for multiple different analyses

#### Advantages

- Lower-level datasets ("subdatasets") have an independent stand-alone history (**modularity** `r emoji::emoji("sparkles")`)
- The top-level "superdataset" only stores *which version* of the subdataset is currently used
- Subdatsets need to be updated explictly
{{content}}

--

#### Git users

- A subdataset is essentially a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/de/v2/Git-Tools-Submodule)
- The version is registered using the [shasum](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-shasum) of the latest commit of the cloned subdataset

### `r emoji::emoji("question")` "*Do you keep data on Tardis temporally until all analyses are completed?*"
### `r emoji::emoji("question")` "*How do you manage input / output links within DataLad datasets?*"

---

# Summary

#### `r emoji::emoji("question")` "*Do you primarily work on Tardis? What is there to consider?*"

- DataLad works on Tardis as it works on your computer (it's not really different)
- With the dataset installed on both locations, you can flexibly update data back-and-forth

#### `r emoji::emoji("question")` "*Do you keep data on Tardis temporally until all analyses are completed?*"

- Yes, just because it's convenient `r emoji::emoji("innocent")`
- You can always `datalad drop` contents from Tardis at any time (if you can retrieve them from elsewhere)

#### `r emoji::emoji("question")` "*How do you manage input / output links within DataLad datasets?*"

- Ideally, datasets are self-contained (cf. [nesting](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-106-nesting.html) and [YODA](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-127-yoda.html))
- Depends on your coding (see e.g., `here` in R, [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) and [here](https://here.r-lib.org/))


---

# A basic workflow for DataLad on Tardis

1\. Create a new dataset directly on Tardis: `datalad create my_dataset`
  
--
  
2\. Start on your computer and move to Tardis
  - Create a dataset on your computer: `datalad create my_dataset`
  - Push the dataset to your hosting service (e.g., [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/)): `datalad push --to gin`
  - Clone the dataset to Tardis: `datalad clone gin.g-node.org//my_username/my_dataset` (using SSH)

--

Moving back-and-forth between your computer and Tardis:
1. Run analysis on Tardis
1. Save changes (either on your computer or on Tardis): `datalad save -m "superduper changes"`
1. Push changes to your hosting service (e.g., [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/)): `datalad push --to gin`
1. Update the clone (either on your computer or on Tardis): `datalad update --merge -s gin`
1. (Optional: Check if your repo is at the correct commit: `git log` / `git log --oneline -n 1`)
1. (Optional: Drop contents of the previous commit: `datalad drop .`)
1. Get the updated contents of the new commit: `datalad get .`

├── zoo-bids
├── zoo-fmriprep
  └── inputs
    └── bids
└── zoo-mriqc
  └── inputs
    └── bids
```

#### Add `zoo-bids` as an input to `zoo-fmriprep` and `zoo-mriqc`

1\. Clone from hosting service (e.g., GIN), add a `local` sibling:
  - `datalad clone --dataset . git@gin.g-node.org:/lnnrtwttkhn/zoo-bids inputs/bids`
  - `datalad siblings add --name local --url ../../../zoo-bids`

2\. Clone from local (and add GIN remote later):
  - `datalad clone --dataset . ../zoo-bids inputs/bids`
  - `datalad siblings add --name gin --url git@gin.g-node.org:/lnnrtwttkhn/zoo-bids`

Getting data from local will be *much* faster! `r emoji::emoji("fire")`

1\. We are still lacking *MPIB-hosted* infrastructure to host DataLad datasets
  - We have a [GitLab](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/explore/projects) instance to host dataset *structure*
  - We have an *experimental* [in-house GIN instance](http://gin.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/) with 5TB that can also host annexed data
  - We have [KEEPER](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/accounts/login/?next=/) (cloud-sharing service with 1TB by the [MPDL](https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/)) which can be configured as a [DataLad special remote](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-138-sharethirdparty.html#the-common-case-repository-hosting-without-annex-support-and-special-remotes)

- free and open-source (could be hosted within MPIs / MPG)
- supports private and public repositories
- publicly funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)
- servers are on German land (near Munich, Germany)
- provides Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) (details [here](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/DOI))
- allows to set own license (details [here](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/Licensing))
- DataLad plays perfectly with GIN, since both use git + git-annex (details [here](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-139-gin.html))

datalad create my_dataset
```

--

2\. Save data into the dataset

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
datalad save -m "add data to dataset"
```

--

3\. Add the GIN remote ("sibling")

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
datalad siblings add -d . --name gin --url git@gin.g-node.org:/my_username/my_dataset.git
```

--

4\. Transfer the dataset to GIN

```{bash, eval=FALSE}

> "*We share all code used in this study. An overview of all the resources is publicly available on our **project website.**"*

Project website publicly available at https://wittkuhn.mpib.berlin/highspeed/

--

#### Reproducible reports with [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) / [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

> *"R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code [...]"*

- Project documentation and main statistical analyses are written in RMarkdown (see [here](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/highspeed-analysis/tree/master/code))
- Documentation pages showcase non-executed code (used in subdatasets) in Python and Bash
- Statistical analyses are executed and website rendered automatically via [Continuous Integreation / Deployment (CI/CD)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/):
  1. In the [main project repository](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed), all RMarkdown files are [combined](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/_bookdown.yml#L22-36) using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) (across subdatasets)
  1. Input data is [automatically retrieved](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L5-75) from GIN and / or Keeper using DataLad (run in a [Docker container](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.docker/datalad/Dockerfile))
  1. The RMarkdown files are [run in Docker](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.docker/bookdown/Dockerfile) (executing main statistical analyses) and [rendered](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L99) into a static website
  1. The static website is [deployed to GitLab pages](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L95-106)

&rarr; This pipeline is automatically triggered on every push (change) to the main repository.

# Software containers and virtual environments

#### Software containers

> *"Containers allow a researcher to package up a project with all of the parts it needs - such as libraries, dependencies, and system settings - and ship it all out as one package."* (see [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/renv/renv-containers.html#what-are-containers))

- `highspeed-bids`: containerized conversion of MRI data to BIDS using [HeuDiConv](https://hub.docker.com/r/nipy/heudiconv)
- `highspeed-fmriprep`: containerized execution of pre-processing pipeline [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/singularity.html)
- `highspeed-mriqc`: containerized creation of MRI quality reports using [MRIQC](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docker.html)
- `highspeed-analysis`: containerized execution of statistical analyses in [custom R container](https://git.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/wittkuhn/highspeed/-/blob/master/.docker/bookdown/Dockerfile)
- `tools`, a personal collection of commonly used containers in a DatLad dataset (see [details](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/tools))

--

#### Virtual environments (e.g., [in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html))

> *"[...] it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. The solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages."*

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Summary, outlook, challenges and discussions

> *"He [Jon Claerbout] has also pointed out that we have reached a point where solutions are available - it is now possible to publish computational research that is really reproducible by others.*"

Buckheit & Donoho (1995), describing how Jon Claerbout and his team shared CD-ROMs with interactive code that could regenerate the figures in their books - in the *early 90s* *(addition in parantheses)*

--

#### The technical solutions are already available!

- Code and data management using Git / DataLad
- Reproducible computational environments using software containers
- Reliance on community standards for data organization and code style guides
- Project management via issue boards and pull / merge requests on GitHub / GitLab
- Focus education on reproducible science and technical skills

--

#### The long-term challenges are largely non-technical:
- moving towards a "culture of reproducibility" (cf. Russ Poldrack, see e.g., [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjW3t-qXAiE))
- changing incentives / funding schemes
- education, education, education
- implementing "slow science" (see e.g., [Frith, 2020, *TICS*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2019.10.007))

# Take-home message

#### Science like open-source software development

We have all the tools we need to make science fully transparent and reproducible available today!

--

#### "*What can I do to get started?*"

1. Learn about Git
1. Learn about DataLad
1. Learn about software containers

... and reproducible you may be! `r emoji::emoji("sparkles")`

# Discussion about potential limitations

#### "*That's too technical*"

- Many research fields become increasingly data-intense and computation-heavy
- Computational / programming skills are increasingly sought-after in the (non-)academic job market
- Focus on education and technical support

--

#### "*Why these tools? Can't we use something else?*"

- Git is used by software developers for way more than a decade
- GitHub has > 50 million users worldwide
- These tools are well-established, open-source, free to use and **available today**

# Challenge: Relationship between code and data

- *"Which code produced which data?"*
- *"In which order do I need to execute the code?"*

--

#### Example solutions

- [datalad run](http://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/generated/man/datalad-run.html)

> `datalad run` *"[...] will record a shell command, and save all changes this command triggered in the dataset – be that new files or changes to existing files."* (see [details](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/basics-run.html) in the DataLad handbook)

- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

> *"Make enables [...] to build and install your package without knowing the details of how that is done -- because these details are recorded in the makefile that you supply."*

> *"Make figures out automatically which files it needs to update, based on which source files have changed. It also automatically determines the proper order for updating files [...]"*

# P1: *"One thing, one dataset"*

- Structure study elements (data, code, results) in dedicated directories
- Input data in `/inputs`, code in `/code`, results in `/outputs`, execution environments in `/envs`
- Use dedicated projects for multiple different analyses

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="60%", fig.retina=1, fig.cap='see <a href="https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-127-yoda.html" target="_blank">DataLad Handbook: YODA: Best practices for data analyses in a dataset</a>'}

# P2: *"Record where you got it from, and where it is now"*


- Record where the data came from, or how it is dependent on or linked to other data
- Link re-usable data resource units as DataLad *subdatasets*
- `datalad clone`, `datalad download-url`, `datalad save`

- Know how exactly the content of every file came to be that was not obtained from elsewhere
- `datalad run` links input data with code execution to output data
- `datalad containers-run` allows to do the same *within* software containers (e.g., Docker or Singularity)
